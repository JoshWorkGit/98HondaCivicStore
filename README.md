`npm install`

## Starting the server

`npm start`

## Starting the client

1. Install the client package globally

`cd client`
`npm install`

1. Start the client.

5. Open a browser and go to the url the client is running on.

## Team project 1

1. Each team member should have a github account where they'll make a fork of this repo.
2. Each team member should clone their fork of the repo to their local machine.

   You can do this by opening VS Code, creating a new window (File > New Window) an selecting clone git repo from the Welcome screen or by entering `git clone [your-repo-url]` into a terminal window.

3. Have a brief planning session with your team and together pick one feature to work on.
   Hint: pick something small to start with.
4. One person will serve as the driver. They'll share their screen and create a new branch for the feature and will do the coding while explaining what they're doing. The other team members will provide feedback and ask questions.
5. When the feature is done, the driver will merge the changes into their repo's develop branch and push the changes to the remote.
6. Go to github and navigate to this repo and create a pull request to merge your new branch into this repo's develop branch.
7. Go back to step 3 and switch drivers.
8. Repeat until the time for the exercise is over.
